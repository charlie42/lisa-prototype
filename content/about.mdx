## What is LISA?

### Background and significance

While educational institutions sometimes model all children as small variations around an “average” child, in many cases, this approach has led to negative outcomes. Some children have significant perceptual, psychological or cognitive differences with the typical population (dyslexia, ASD, ADHD…) that make educational material and approaches designed for an hypothetical “average” child largely irrelevant. Even in cases that don’t fit a clinically labeled disorder, the “average child” approach is questionable, as no child actually fits this hypothetical model - leading to an unfit approach for the vast majority of children.

Recent advances in psychology and cognitive science suggest it is possible to establish a more fine-grained learning profile for children, upon which families and teachers could provide them with better support. However, for mostly historical reasons, psychologists and teachers have mostly been kept apart, preventing collaboration for the benefit of the children. At best, families are directed to psychologists when problems arise.

The scope of this project is to develop a conceptual and practical framework to provide better support for each child: the definition of a relevant model, the design of realistic, affordable and reliable assessment tools for this model, and the implementation of practical recommendations for families and teachers based on these assessments.
